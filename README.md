Is it possible for you to create a tutorial curriculum to teach me how to use JavaScript step by step as in a classroom environment? 

 Can you create this with follow up questions to check for understanding and progressively introduce me to new concepts and help me master them?

Absolutely! I can create a tutorial curriculum to teach you JavaScript step by step in a classroom environment with follow-up questions and progressively introduce you to new concepts. Here's a 10-session curriculum outline for you:

## Session 1: Introduction to JavaScript and Setting Up the Environment

## What is JavaScript?
* Why learn JavaScript?
* Setting up the development environment
* Browser console and developer tools
* Writing your first JavaScript program
* Follow-up question: What is the purpose of the 'console.log()' function?
* Session 2: Variables, Data Types, and Basic Operators


## Session 2: Variables, Data Types, and Basic Operators
Variables and constants
Data types
Basic operators
Operator precedence and associativity
Follow-up question: How do you declare a constant variable in JavaScript?

## Session 3: Control Structures and Loops

Conditional statements (if, else, else if)
Switch statement
Loops (for, while, do-while)
Follow-up question: What is the main difference between a 'while' loop and a 'do-while' loop?

## Session 4: Functions and Scope

Function parameters and arguments
Return values
Scope of variables
Follow-up question: What is the difference between local and global scope in JavaScript?

## Session 5: Arrays and Array Methods

Creating arrays

Array methods (push, pop, shift, unshift, slice, splice, etc.)
Follow-up question: What is the main difference between the 'slice()' and 'splice()' array methods?

## Session 6: Objects, Properties, and Methods

Creating objects
Accessing and modifying properties
Object methods

## Session 8: Events and Event Handlers

Introduction to events
Event handlers and listeners
Event propagation (bubbling and capturing)
Preventing default behavior
Follow-up question: What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?

## Session 9: Asynchronous JavaScript

Introduction to asynchronous programming
Callback functions
Promises
Async/Await
Follow-up question: What is the main advantage of using async/await over traditional callback functions?

## Session 10: Final Project

Review of concepts learned
Building a small JavaScript project
Debugging and troubleshooting

## Next steps and resources for learning
This curriculum will introduce you to JavaScript concepts step by step, and the follow-up questions provided after each session will help you check your understanding of the material covered. As you progress through the sessions, you'll gain confidence and mastery of the language. Good luck, and enjoy learning JavaScript!
